Yesterday, we got a new classmate. 0 seems to be a nice person, 2 name is 4. 0's from another country and fluent in three languages, I hope I can become friends with 1!
4 and I have been friends since primary school. Next year I will hopefully move together with 1 in our own apartment!
I'm sorry, but 4 isn't here right now. I'm just 2 friend, do you want to leave a message for 1 or should 0 call back later?
Have you heard that 4 recently started a YouTube channel? I have watched every single video and 0 is so funny! I hope 2 YouTube channel gains more attention soon, 0 deserves it!
4 is a very good artist! 0 doesn't have much confidence in 3, but I know 0 will see how wonderful 0 is some day.
Do you know 4? 0 is James' younger sibling and goes to another school and plays the piano. I recently heard 2 playing and 0's so talented!
I'm gonna be hanging out with 4 today, 0 wanted me to help with 2 homework and then play some games together.
I enjoy going to the beach with my friend 4, we're so different, but still get along very well, 0â€™s currently on a gap year in Europe, but we still facetime and talk everyday.
Your computer isn't working? You have to see 4 about that, 0's such a talented person when it comes to fixing them. I dont know 0 very well, but I can give you 2 number or email address.
Do you remember 4? We went to middle school together, 0 was that person who always got an A in math. Yesterday, I met 1 in the cinema, we exchanged phone numbers. I hope we can meet up soon again, 4 is such a nice person!
Do you know if 4 is alright? 0 didn't reply to my last message, I hope 0 is good. I think I'll call 1 after school or visit 1 later.
Do you want to hang out with me and 4 today? 0 and I planned to watch a horror movie tonight, I'm sure 0 will be happy if you join us!
